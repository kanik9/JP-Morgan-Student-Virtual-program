What task containd in this program. 

            You’re going to assist with some development of an alternative way to visualize and analyze share price             data for our traders – this will alert them of potential trading opportunities.

            JPMorgan Chase has traders in all the major financial centers and creates a marketplace for asset                   classes around the globe for our investor clients. Trading teams are organized by asset class:

                Equities (stocks)
                Commodities
                Credit (debt and bonds)
                Currency & Emerging Markets
                Public Finance (Government bonds)
                Interest rates
                Securitized Products
            For this project, a trader from the equities team (publicly listed company stocks) has requested                   functionality be added to their dashboard to allow them to input specific information so they can                   monitor a new trading strategy.

            In order to do this, you’ll need to set up your system so you can interface with the relevant financial             data feed, make the required calculations and then present this in a way that allows the traders to                 visualize and analyze this data in real time.

            The visualization of charts and data analysis our trader’s see is all built on JPMorgan Chase's own                 open sourced software called Perspective. You’ll learn how to implement this to facilitate the trader’s             requested changes and deliver actionable insights.

            You’ll have to gain an understanding of the user requirements and then build something that meets those             requirements.
